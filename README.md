##JavaScript Conditionals

***This repo contains my solution to the following exercise:***

1. Create a blank, valid HTML5 document.
1. Create a JavaScript file
1. Prompt the user to enter their phone number with dashes (XXX-XXX-XXX)
1. Alert the user if their phone number is valid (True or False) according to the simple rule that the fourth and eighth characters must be dashes.
1. Following the same procedure, prompt and validate the following fields:
  - birth date (xx/xx/xx)
  - postal code (xxxxx OR xxxxx-xxxx)
  - state abbreviation (XX)
  - married ("yes" or "no" or "YES" or "NO" or "Yes" or "No")
